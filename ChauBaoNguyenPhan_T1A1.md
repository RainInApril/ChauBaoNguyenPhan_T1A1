## `Q1. Identify and explain common and important components and concepts of web development markup languages`

*A markup language is a language used in web documents or applications (in industries such as vector graphics, content syndication or interface creation), that annotates text so that it may be manipulated by a computer.*

To distinguish themselves from text, most markup languages are human-readable, invisible to reader of a website or document, and can only be view by accessing the source code. They are also get read and rendered as opposed to programming’s executed unintelligible syntax.

Tags are used to define distinct elements across a markup language document. The tags are denoted by angle brackets (< and >), and whatever is contained between the tags is represented by formatted content. Depending on how it is used or its position in a document, markup can be either semantic or presentational.

Most markup languages are defined by an outside authority such as the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) for use by a wide range of people. 

There are many markup languages but the most used for web development are:
* __HTML__ – Hypertext Markup Language (designed for displaying data)
* __XML__ – eXtensible Markup Language (designed for storing and transporting data)
* __XHTML__ – eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language (is a combination of HTML and XML)

## `Q2. Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet and explain how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet:`

## __Packets__ 

*Data such as email, images, video, etc. when sent from one IP to another IP over computer networks such as the internet get broken down into smaller fragments called packets.*

Each packets contains 1,000 - 1,500 bytes which includes:
* A header: includes IP addresses of the sender and receiver
* Data: the actual content, such as part of an image or a web page

These packets get sent off by the best available route as this makes the network more efficient. Once arrived at the allocated destination, these packets are then combined by the device that receives them. Other names of packets includes frame, block, cell, segment.

## __IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)__

*An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical identification assigned to each device connected to a computer network that communicates using the IP protocol. An IP address serves as a unique identification for a single device on a network.*

An IP address is also known as an IP number or an Internet address, it serves the purpose of providing an address for devices to send and receive messages (aka. data) over computer networks such as the internet.

**Some differences between IPv4 vs IPv6:**

IPv4: 
* 32-Bit IP address
* Numerical addressing method
* Binary bits are separated by a dot (.)
	
IPv6:
* 128-Bit IP address
* Alphanumeric addressing method
* Binary bits are separated by a colon (:), also contains hexadecimal.

IPv4 is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol (IP), whereas IPv6 is the latest version. Hence, IPv6 is more advanced, secure, and faster than IPv4.

## __Routers and Routing__

***Routers** are hardware devices developed with the main purpose of finding the most efficient path through which the IP packets can be transferred from source to destination across networks.*

It checks IP packet headers, including the destination address, and consults a table of known network. The table specifies which connections should be utilised as the next link to send each packet. 

***Routing** is the process of selecting the best route for sending data packets and can be divided into two categories of static and dynamic.*

* Static: routes are set manually and must be corrected manually if there are changes in the networks

* Dynamic: routes are set by software according to the current state of the network and automatically updates if there are any changes to the networks

**Routers** and **routing** help improve the speed of sending and downloading data packets over the internet, making it more accessible for more people.

## __Domains and DNS__

***Domains** also known as domain name, URL (Uniform Resource Locator), web address is an identifier that the internet users can use to find the location of a website.*

A **domain** could be linked to multiple IP addresses. A domain name can contain a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 63 characters.

***DNS** (Domain Name System) helps computers talk to each other by converting a host name (i.e., www.google.com) to IP addresses such as 8.8.8.8.) adding efficiency and even security in the process, it's basically the internet's phonebook.*

**DNS** is managed by a non-profit organisation called internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which develops and executes the policies for domain names.

**Domains** and **DNS** helps make it much easier for internet users to access websites by enable them to lookup an IP address with a domain name rather than having to remember the IP address.

## `Q3. Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet, and explain how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet (50 - 150 words for each technology):`

## __TCP__

***TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) is used in conjunction with IP and commonly referred to as TCP/IP suite as it's one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite.*

TCP's main purpose is to check the packets sent from the server for errors, ask for packets to be resent, assembling them once arrived at the client's device and let the sender know whether the packets has been received successfully. It maintains a connection with the sender from the very beginning and end of this process, and *"a connection between client and server is established before data can be sent."* (Wikipedia, 2022)

## __HTTP and HTTPS__


***HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a method of data communication for the internet, it focuses on presenting the information but neglects on how the information is being transfer from one location to another.*

Data transfer using **HTTP** can be intercepted and manipulated by third parties, exposing both the information and the receiver of these information in danger.

***HTTPS** is a similar but younger, more advanced, and more secure version of HTTP.*

The "S" stands for the word "Secure”, HTTPS originally uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to move data, but it is now replaced by (TLS) Transport Layer Security (TLS) the *"security technology that establishes an encrypted connection between a web server and a browser.”* (Vukadinovic, 2018)

**HTTPS** helps secure data transfer between the client and server.

## __Web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)__

*A **web brower** is an application software that can be use by people around the world to access the World Wide Web via devices such as desktops, laptops, tablets, mobiles, etc.*

**Requests** are sent from the client to a server connected to the internet to retrieve information (data). The data is then transferred via HTTP and a piece of software known as a **rendering** engine is used to convert it into text and graphics. This information is written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), and web browsers process this code to display on our devices. **Developer tools** were created to help web developers with the main purpose of debugging code and testing user interface, they are part of an add-ons or built-in features of a web browser. (Wikipedia, 2022)

## `Q4. Identify THREE data structures used in the Ruby programming language and explain the reasons for using each.`

## __Arrays__

**Array** is a data structure represents a collection of ordered, integer-indexed values (string, number, symbols, etc). Array positive index starts from 0 and negative index starts from -1. Arrays can be used to collect items, retrieve result from a loop and as the foundation for more complex data structure.

Example of what assigning values an Array looks like:

```
array_name = [value_1, value_2, value_3]
```

## __Hashes__

Hash is another data structure that assigned a key for every value, so that the value can be looked up using the key. The key in a key/value pair can be anything (string, integer, symbol, etc.) and you can have as many key/value pairs as you need in a hash. These key/value pairs must be surrounded by curly braces { } and separated by commas (,)

•	Some uses of Hash include naming and initialize objects, naming method arguments, counting characters in a string, find duplicates inside an array, mapping words to definitions, names to phone numbers, etc. (RubyGuides, 2022)

Example of what an old Hash syntax uses symbols as keys looks like:
```
{:one => "value_1", :two => "value_2", :three => "value_3"}
```

Example of what a new Hash syntax uses symbols as keys looks like:
```
{one: "value_1", two: "value_2", three: "value_3"}
```

## __Trie__

A Trie (aka. digital tree or prefix tree) is a tree data structure used for locating keys inside a set. *“These keys are most often strings, with links between nodes defined not by the entire key, but by individual characters”* (Wikipedia, 2022). It's useful for working with words, swiftly looking for terms that begin with a prefix or searching for the entire word; and it’s commonly used in word games, spelling checkers and auto complete suggestions. (RubyGuides, 2022)

## `Q5. Describe the features of interpreters and compilers and how they are different.`

## __Interpreters__

Interpreter is a computer program that converts the source code to machine code, and often offer features such as dynamic typing and smaller program size.

## __Compilers__

Compiler is a translator that takes inputs from high level programming language (C, C++, Java, etc.) and produces outputs in machine or assembly language (binary 1 & 0) that the processor can execute. Compilers checks for error, range, limits, etc.

**Differences between Interpreters and Compilers are:**

Interpreters:
* Translate one statement at a time
* Take less time to analyse source code but more time to execute
* Used by Ruby, JavaScript, Python, etc.

Compilers:
* Scan the entire document and then translate
* Take more time to analyse source code but less time to execute
* Used by C, C++, Java, etc.

## `Q6. Identify TWO commonly used programming languages and explain the benefits and drawbacks of each.`

## __Ruby__

```

## `Q13. The code snippet below looks for the first two elements that are out of order and swaps them; however, it is not producing the correct results. Rewrite the code so that it works correctly.`

```
arr = [5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]
i = 0
while (i < arr.size - 1 and arr[i] < arr[i + 1])
    i = i + 1 end
puts i
    arr[i] = arr[i + 1]
    arr[i + 1] = arr[i]
```

## `Q14. Demonstrate your algorithmic thinking through completing the following two tasks, in order:`
